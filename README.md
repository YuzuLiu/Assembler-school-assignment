# Assembler-school-assignment
An assembler, converting from 8051 to machine code.
Because I've just learn python, thinking this may be a chance to practice.
Therefore, the code itself may not be efficient or well-organized.

P.S. This code only converts partial instruction sets in 8051,
    maybe I'll finish it in the future.
